## Main subprojects

### securities-case-service

securities-case-services implements the services for this application and contains its domain model.
The domain model is simple. There are is an Instrument class and a Price class. An instrument has a code and price. 
A price has a timestamp and an amount. The services module contains the InstrumentService (spring component) which can be used to retrieve all instruments with their latest prices. It is also possible to register a InstrumentListener which will callback in case a price of an instrument is updated.
To simulate real instrument price updates a spring scheduler is used which randomly updates prices every second and triggers the callback.


### securities-case-web

securities-case-web implements a REST API to retrieve the instrument list '/instruments' and contains a websocket to retrieve updates of instrument prices.
